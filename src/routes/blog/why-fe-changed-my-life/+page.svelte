        March 14th, 2024: Buckle up, because this was the day my life got a
        whole lot furrier! I took the plunge and went to my first-ever furry
        convention – Furnal Equinox: Under the Sea in Toronto – and let me tell
        you, it was an absolute WILD ride!
    </p>

        The flight experience with Air Canada to YYZ
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-300">
        Even though this wasn't my first flight, tackling Toronto Pearson still
        gave me a rush. It's a massive airport, and I'm one anxious floof,
        especially when hyped up for a big event!
        <br /><br />
        We took off at 5:27 am sharp. The flight itself was smooth – they had movies,
        snacks, the works! The hardest part was battling the tiredness. But hey,
        when you're running on coffee, adrenaline, and the dream of your favorite
        Canadian city and a furry con, who needs sleep?
        <br /><br />
        We landed around 7:00 am, and my first taste of the airport was the usual
        organized chaos. People everywhere! I just followed the signs for the "UP
        Express - To City", and luckily, made it to the train on time.

        UP Express, why is the sky so blue?
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-300">
        Hopping on the UP Express was a whole new experience – it was my first
        train ride ever! I was amazed by how smooth it was, a total change from
        my airport jitters. But the real jaw-dropper? The sky! Forget the winter
        blah I'm used to back home. Here, it was a canvas of vibrant blue and
        orange morning colors. That, with the rising buildings and a peek at the
        CN Tower? It felt like the perfect scene to welcome me to the city!

        TTC, Google Maps Gone Wild, & the Metrolinx Escape!
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-300">
        Toronto weather surprised me! Coming from a chilly -8°C at home, I
        landed in a glorious summer day with sunny skies and a balmy 18°C.
        Perfect for exploring!
        <br /><br />
        My first adventure was navigating the TTC to Don Mills Station. There, I
        met up with my friend h33t for some catching up before heading straight to
        the CN Tower. The views were incredible, and with no fear of heights, I even
        conquered the Skypod, the highest point accessible to visitors!
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, the afternoon took a turn. Rain started pouring down, and
        my trusty Google Maps went rogue, leaving me lost in downtown Toronto. Talk
        about panic! Finding Union Station for shelter in the downpour proved to
        be quite the challenge. Luckily, a friend came to my rescue and helped me
        navigate to the GO Train at Union Station. The train experience, thankfully,
        was a welcome change - quiet, comfy, and clean!
        <br /><br />
        From there, it was a race against the clock. I grabbed my keys for the Airbnb,
        registered for FE 2024 before nightfall, all while getting absolutely soaked!
        Frustrated about missing the Thursday night dances, I fueled up with h33t
        at a fancy ramen place in Toronto – chopsticks and all, a first for me!
        <br /><br />
        Despite the rain-drenched chaos, the day had its highlights. The CN Tower
        experience was amazing, and conquering my chopsticks was a small victory.
        Toronto may have thrown some curveballs, but it was definitely an adventure!
